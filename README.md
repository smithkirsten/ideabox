# IdeaBox  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (
We built an application called Idea Box, that allows a user to create a card containing a new idea. 
The user can add a title and a body of text to the idea cards. If the card has both the title and a body they are able to save it into an array and it will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Users can click a star in the upper left hand corner to favorite an idea, or the x in the upper right hand corner to delete the card.
)

### Learning Goals:
-we wanted to gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS. There still a lot to learn, but as a team we have grown a lot in our understanding.
-Incorporating and iterating over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed was quite a challenge, and in the end we didn't turn in a search function do to a few bugs, but we learned a lot about iterating through our displays.

### Wins + Challenges:
-Wins:
	- We were really close to getting the display favorites function to work without bugs and with more time, we suspect we would have been successful in working out the last bug. We did have the building blocks for the search feature which we were excited to try, but did not have time to implement before the due date. It felt like a win to be able to see the finish line, even though we didnâ€™t get there by the time the horn blew!
	-Quynh and Michael got the disable function to work beautifully, which was the first time they had attempted that.
	-Kirsten and John celebrated both the initial creation of the data model and being able to successfully refactor DOM-related functions to make them more dynamic, which because necessary in later iterations.
	-Maintaining kindness and consideration as a team, in the midst of project stress!
-Challenges:
	-Early on, we experienced a HUGE obstacle that set us back several hours. The quotation marks in our scripts element had somehow picked up some near-invisible stylizing that made them entirely dysfunctional. After many hours of tearing apart our code and looking for the problem, one of our instructors was finally able to narrow it down to the quotation marks. It was a pretty tough start to the project and we lost a lot of valuable work time to that issue.
	-Working across 3 different time zones was a challengegit
